Practical No. 1 — SQL DDL Statements: College Library Management System
1. Create Database
CREATE DATABASE CollegeLibrary;
USE CollegeLibrary;
________________________________________
2. Create Tables
(a) Student Table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Department VARCHAR(30),
    Year INT CHECK (Year BETWEEN 1 AND 4),
    Email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO Student
(StudentID, Name, Department, Year, Email)
values
(1,"mohit","Computer",3,"mohitdake@gmail.com"),
(2,"Suesh","IT",2,"sueshshinde@gmail.com"),
(3,"Kiran","E&TC",3,"kiran@gmail.com"),
(4,"Mahim","Computer",1,"mahimsingh@gmail.com"),
(5,"Vasu","Computer",1,"vasudake@gmail.com");
________________________________________
(b) Book Table
CREATE TABLE Book (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Author VARCHAR(50),
    Publisher VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(8,2) CHECK (Price > 0),
    Availability CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'Y'  -- Y = Available, N = Not Available
);

INSERT INTO book
(BookID, Title, Author, Publisher, Price, Availability)
values
(1,"SECRET","J.M.THOMAS","RKSTUDIOS",285,"Y"),
(2,"ISEKAI","SHIKIKAVA SORO","JAVASTUD",350,"Y"),
(3,"CHAVA","ASUTOSH MUGDALKAR","HINDLTD",200,"N"),
(4,"CHITAMANI","ASUTOSH KELKAR","NAVNATYA",325,"Y");

________________________________________
(c) Transaction Table
CREATE TABLE Transaction (
    TransID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    BookID INT,
    IssueDate DATE NOT NULL,
    ReturnDate DATE,
    Status VARCHAR(10) CHECK (Status IN ('Issued', 'Returned')),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Book(BookID)
);
INSERT INTO Transaction (TransID, StudentID, BookID, IssueDate, ReturnDate, Status)
VALUES
(101, 1, 1, '2025-10-10', NULL, 'Issued'),
(102, 2, 3, '2025-09-15', '2025-09-25', 'Returned'),
(103, 3, 4, '2025-11-01', NULL, 'Issued');

________________________________________
3. Create a View
(View showing issued books with student details)
CREATE VIEW Issued_Books AS
SELECT S.Name AS StudentName, B.Title AS BookTitle, T.IssueDate, T.Status
FROM Transaction T
JOIN Student S ON T.StudentID = S.StudentID
JOIN Book B ON T.BookID = B.BookID
WHERE T.Status = 'Issued';
________________________________________
4. Create an Index
(Create index on Book title for faster search)
CREATE INDEX idx_book_title ON Book (Title);
________________________________________

5. Create a Synonym
-- create a view that acts like a synonym
CREATE VIEW LibBook AS
SELECT * FROM Book;
________________________________________
6. Verify the View
SELECT * FROM Issued_Books;
